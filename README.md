# Projects
This repository contains educational projects in programming, modeling, statistics and machine learning. 
Individual projects were completed entirely by me; for projects in a group, areas of responsibility are indicated below.

## Platelets Clustering
This project was carried out as part of the course "Programming and Algorithms", and is a study on methods of machine analysis of cytometric data. As part of this work, various clustering methods and clustering quality metrics are considered. Based on the results of the study, a script was proposed for simplified processing of experiments on the study of platelet subpopulations.

## Hodgkin-Huxley Model
This project was carried out as part of the course "Computational Biology. Neurobiology", and represents a numerical simulation of the full model of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron, as well as a bifurcation analysis of the reduced 2-dimensional model. My task was to write code for this project.

## T-test Investigation
The aim of this practical as a part of "Probability and Statistics" course is to investigate the properties of the two-sample t-test using simulated data. The practical was conducted in the R programming language.
